# mosh cookbook

This cookbook will install [Mosh](http://mosh.mit.edu).

Mosh is packaged for most current major platforms. This cookbook leverages existing repositories - community or base/built in - by default. The installation strategy of compiling from source is not supported or recommended.

# Requirements

## Platforms

This cookbook should work on major platforms that package mosh, including Ubuntu 12.04+, Fedora, CentOS/RHEL (via EPEL), OS X (via homebrew), and others.

## Cookbooks

The following cookbooks are dependencies:

* [apt](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/apt) to seamlessly setup the PPA on Ubuntu older than 12.04.
* [yum-epel](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/yum) to seamlessly setup EPEL for RHEL paltforms.

# Attributes

See `attributes/default.rb` for default values.

* `node['mosh']['package_name']` - the name of the "mosh" package. change this if your platform doesn't name it "mosh."
* `node['mosh']['use_ppa']` - whether to use the Ubuntu PPA. Should only be necessary on Ubuntu versions earlier than 12.04.
* `node['mosh']['use_epel']` - whether to use EPEL. Should only be necessary on RHEL and derivatives. Fedora packages mosh, so it shouldn't be necessary there (Fedora is not considered an `rhel` platform).

# Recipes

## default

Installs the mosh package using the package installation instructions
from the [Mosh home page](http://mosh.mit.edu). Should work on the
following platforms:

* Ubuntu
* Debian
* Fedora
* ArchLinux
* Gentoo
* Mac OS X
